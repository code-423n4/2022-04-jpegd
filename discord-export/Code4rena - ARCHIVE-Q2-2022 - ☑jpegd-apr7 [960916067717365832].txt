Okay, I need the files to go up. I can't take this anymore. Every hour I'm checking the repo and it's unchanged. Every hour, I check the repo - no change. I can't take this anymore, man. I have overinvested - by a lot. It is what it is. I need the interfaces / tests to go up. Can devs @Spaghetti dev @pool do something?

Hi, I am trying to understand totalDebtPortion, would you mind expounding on what it means/how it is used?


[04/07/2022 6:02 PM] dimitri01#5993
maybe will be more clear now that tests are shared


[04/07/2022 6:04 PM] _pool
it's used wherever _calculateDebt is called, and tracks the portion of the global protocol debt that's from user loan principal values

What's the idea behind locking jpeg to increase NFT value ?

Why does the JPEG's DAO have power to mint infinite token JPEG? Does DAO not worry about user questioning rugpull potential?

What's the benefit of staking JPEG to receive sJPEG? Are there any rewards payed out or protocol revenue sharing? I could not find anything in code.


[04/11/2022 8:26 PM] Spaghetti dev#9116
yeah for now sJPEG doesn't do anything, it's probably gonna be something we'll add in later. Either that or we'll simply remove the contract

Judging has just been completed. We're just giving the sponsor an opportunity to review the judge's decisions before we calculate the awards.


[05/02/2022 10:04 PM] okkothejawa
Do you have a guess regarding when it would finish, we are a bit excited/nervous about the results :)


[05/02/2022 10:13 PM] liveactionllamac4
It is really dependent on whether the sponsor and judge decide they need to discuss anything further, as we want to make sure all looks good before proceeding. 🙂
If all goes well though, I wouldn't be surprised if awards were announced later this week. 🤞
